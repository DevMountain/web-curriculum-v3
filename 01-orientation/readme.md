### Discord

All students should create a discord account and join the DevMountain Web server: https://discord.gg/damAMps.  Students should change their display name to be their real name.  (This can be done by right clicking your own name in the sidebar and selecting `change nickname`.

### Git/Git-bash

All students should download git.  Mac users can do so at the link below or by typing `git --version` into their terminal or at the following link: 

MacOS - https://git-scm.com/downloads

Windows users should also download git bash, a terminal we will use during the cohort.  This can be done here: 

Windows - https://gitforwindows.org/

### GitHub
Make sure students have a GitHub account. This is also a good time to configure the username, email, and password of GitHub to work with Git that was just installed.

### Node/NPM
Link - https://nodejs.org/en/download/

All students should download and install node.  This will install npm automatically.  

### VSCode
All students must download Visual Studio Code.  This will be our code editor for the duration of the cohort.  

Link - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Students using Macs will need to move the application from their downloads folder to their applications folder.  They will then need to install the code command. This is done by opening VSCode and typing `command + shift + p` to open the search bar. Type `shell command` and select the first option.

Students using windows should change the default terminal in VSCode shell by typing `ctrl + shift + p` to open the search bar. Once the search bar is opened, have the students type `select default shell`. They will be able to select Bash as an option.

### Repl.it

All students should have a repl account.  Use the same email you used to apply for DevMountain

### Canvas

Students should recive an email to create an account for the LMS before starting the program.  If you do not recieve this email, feel free to reach out to us. 

### The Q

Introduce the Q to students, and explain expectations for using the Q. It's generally a good idea to recommend the students bookmark the Q so they have it easily accessible.
